1. In order to Import data to run this script, export from db. The Export is a csv file with the following specifics:

* Fields:
    + Customer Number
    + First Transaction (LT1 Occ Date)
    + Transaction date
    + POS Transaction no
    + Store No
    + Sum(Item Amount Central)
    
* Customer Scope:
    + First Transaction (LT1 Occ Date) 10/01/2012 onwards
    + First Transaction (LT1 Occ Store) in 1:1999 R newbies
    + First Transaction (LT1 Occ Store) in (6101) W newbies

* Transaction scope:
    + Start fiscal first quarter 2015 to date 
    
    + _Note: For reference, Export ID: 17210_ 
    
2. Importing raw data into R data frame and check data for oddities.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr);library(dplyr)
library(scales)
library(grid)

set.seed(666)

install.packages("BTYD", dependencies = T)

library(BTYD)

## Utilizing the more efficient dc.Readlines function to tune data read from supported event log or transaction data file

cdnow_eventLog = system.file("data/cdnowElog.csv", package = "BTYD")

trans_data = dc.ReadLines(cdnow_eventLog, cust.idx = 2, date.idx = 3, sales.idx = 5)

head(trans_data)

# Converting dates from character to datetime format

trans_data$date = as.Date(trans_data$date, "%Y%m%d")

# Pareto/BRD models concerned with inter-purchase time, so need to merge all transaction that had been on the same day

elog = dc.MergeTransactionsOnSameDate(trans_data)

# Splitting dataset into training and testing periods
end.of.cal.period = as.Date("1997-09-30")
elog.train = elog[which(elog$date <= end.of.cal.period),]

## IMP - design step
# We are only concerned with repeat transactions (ignoring the first transaction)

# Later we will join the first trans date info to get the recency indicator

split.data = dc.SplitUpElogForRepeatTrans(elog.train)
clean.elog.train = split.data$repeat.trans.elog

# Now creating the adjacency matrix for each customer per day

freq.cbt = dc.CreateFreqCBT(clean.elog.train)
head(freq.cbt)

## Merging back the large swath of one-and-donners
total.cbt = dc.CreateFreqCBT(elog)
train.cbt = dc.MergeCustomers(total.cbt, freq.cbt)

total.cbt[1:3,1:3]
train.cbt[1:3,1:3]

birth.periods = split.data$cust.data$birth.per
birth.periods[1:10]

last.dates = split.data$cust.data$last.date
last.dates[1:10]

train.cbs.dates = data.frame(birth.periods, last.dates, end.of.cal.period)
tail(train.cbs.dates)

train.cbs = dc.BuildCBSFromCBTAndDates(train.cbt, train.cbs.dates, per = "week")

tail(train.cbs)

# Interpreting the indicators in the final modelling dataset 'train.cbs'
# x: seems like # of Repeat purchases (ie. total purchases minus 1)
# t.x: seems like the days between last 2 purchases (zero for   one-and-donners)
# T.cal: seems like total days alive from the time of birth (since we assume that the user is still active at the end of the training period, in order to calculate P(alive | D)) 


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
