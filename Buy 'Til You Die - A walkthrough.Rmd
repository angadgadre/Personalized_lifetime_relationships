2. Importing raw data into R data frame and check data for oddities.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr);library(dplyr)
library(scales)
library(grid)

set.seed(666)

install.packages("BTYD", dependencies = T)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
