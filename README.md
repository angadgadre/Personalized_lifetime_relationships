Understanding user value/equity

What does a business value? Stock performance if they are a public company; which is in turn related to shareholder confidence among other factors. A private business definitely cares if it is going to make money or profits. It cares about, on an ancillary level, if it is creating value in their customer's lives, right? I'm sure there are other things a business cares about (the environment? haha)

All of these factors are closely tied in with one big thing. It's called Customer value or equity of the business. And not a lot of people think deeply about it. A lot of jargon is thrown around by the finance dept. And sometimes oversimplifications are made. Calculating customer equity needs to be done with due consideration of the domain and business one is considering.  I am here to do just that for my use case.
